    `ansible-role-requirements.yml` is modified to point to a forked
    openstack-ansible-os_neutron repo with a fix to a bug that is 
    causing neutron services to run on old versions after a minor
    upgrade.  This was due to a conflict on the os_neutron and its
    etcd dependancy's handler for reloading the systemd daemon. When
    the .service files were updated the call to reload the systemd 
    daemon was being handled by the etcd role and skipped.  The 
    fix was to rename the handler for os_neutron role to keep the 
    conflict from happening.
